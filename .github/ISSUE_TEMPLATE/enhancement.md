about: Do you miss that one inch of performance? Go this way!

<!--
  Thank you for proposing an enhancement to the app! This might include super
  simple things like small design fixes, but it can also encompass retrofitting
  bigger features with enhanced functionality from new preferences to new actions.
  Please be sure that the enhancement does not interfere with existing workflows
  (backwards-compatibility is still a thing, although we're progressive!).

  Oh, and please also make sure that you prepend "[ENHANCEMENT]" to your issue
  to keep the list easily accessible!
